In vivid3D, From the toolbar you can select between translate, rotation and scale. These operations can be performed on the currently active node
in the scene view, allowing you to move, rotate and scale entities. These buttons are on the left side of the toolbar.

You can also select the space mode, between local and global. Local operations are applied to the current node transform, where as global affects the node with no relation to it's current transform.
